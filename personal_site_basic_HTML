If you are on this website that means that I want you to get to know me better, perhaps you are hiring! In any circumstance I will give you a brief overview. To the left you can see some links to important resources that can help you to better understand me. First thing first, I wrote the code for this website alone, I am self-taught in HTML and CSS.  
</p><br/><p style= "text-indent: 50px; Position: relative; left: 500px">My name is Corey Andrew Shaffer. I am an aspiring developer. I am currently teaching myself Python programming and related technologies such as: Linux Shell, Web design, App development, HTML5, basic Java, JQuery, Flask, and Django. I am learning through a variety of resources such as Udemy, EdX and a number of programming books. For the most part I am spending a lot of my time learning Python right now. However, I am willing to learn any other programming language or tool that is necessary, and I hope you will find that I am a quick study!

Hello Potential Employer,

	My name is Corey Shaffer. I am a self taught computer professional. I have been programming and doing other computer related work for a number of years as a hobby. My Github account has numerous projects that I have worked on. That being said I am by no means an “expert”. I have a thirst for knowledge and wish to grow and learn the craft of computers in a number of fields. I wish to work in Software Engineering, Data Analysis, IT, System Administration, and other fields. I feel I have gotten the basics but there is no greater teacher than experience. I am committed to growing and I hope you will find me a quick learner. 
	I am currently working on mastery in both Python and Perl, but I am willing to learn any language that is needed for the task as well as any other needed skills.
Hobbies of mine include: Hiking, reading, learning new things, and of course programming. I am married to my beautiful wife Lizbeth and we are both looking forward to the changes that becoming a programmer entails. She has helped me a lot in my studies and has always been very supportive of my decision. So, I hope that you have learned a little about me and that you consider me for an interview.
